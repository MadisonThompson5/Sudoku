# Sudoku
Assignmnet details

Using the provided Python or Java template software (btsolver.py and supporting files in Python; 
likewise for Java) available via the EEE class website mini-project page, 
and no other external source of software, write and test a Sudoku problem solver. 
Code up the following methods and heuristics (as defined in R&N Chapter 6 and in lectures) and 
slot them into the template provided: Arc Consistency, MRV, Degree, LCV, Forward Checking, Naked Pairs, and Naked Triples.
For each combination of methods and for each problem instance you try, 
record the number of backtracks your solver does for each problem, 
the total running time divided by the number of backtracks, 
and whether the problem is solved successfully or not. For each combination of methods you try, 
and for each difficulty level in the problem database provided in the Python codebase, 
report the solution capability (success rate, and average number of backtracks) by testing on the difficulty-stratified problem database. 
Use problems PE1 - PE5 (5 easy problems), PM1 - PM5 (5 medium-difficulty problems), and PH1 - PH5 (5 hard problems)
to test each combination of methods specified as follows. Which combinations of methods to try: 
(a) Try each method separately, or with the fewest other methods possible; 
(b) Find a “best” or “most productive” combination of methods as well as you can; 
explain in what sense it is best and what your evidence for that “best” conclusion is. 
(You may want to make a plot of some numerical results to provide the evidence.)
